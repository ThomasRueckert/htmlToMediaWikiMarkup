# htmlToMediaWikiMarkup
convert html sources into mediawiki markup

> the target of this project is to be able to convert the html created by the android app 'PowerWriter' into mediawiki Markup, thats why some obsolete html tags are support and a lot of newer html tags aswell as css aren't

this project is based on 'PHP Simple HTML DOM Parser': http://sourceforge.net/projects/simplehtmldom/files/

## usage

* create an file named 'input.files' and name all files to be converted inside it, seperated by linebreaks
* put the files named inside 'input.files' inside this folder
* then run the file parser.php
